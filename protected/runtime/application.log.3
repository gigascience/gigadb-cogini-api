The captive breeding of pandas follows principles meant to maintain genetic polymorphism, so it is difficult to find a homozygous panda because mating of close relatives is not allowed. The genetic background of Jingjing’s father comes solely from pandas in the Liangshan Mountain, and Jingjing’s mother’s genetic background has half from pandas in the Liangshan Mountain and half from the Minshan Mountain. Liangshan and Minshan are the two major locations of wild giant pandas.
